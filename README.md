Sternplot - a simple online plotter

Created by Gustaf Sterner. This README was written 2012-11-29.

Sternplot is a simple plotter written in html and javascript.

The goal is to make a plotter that with a simple "array-syntax" can plot and evaluate mathematical functions and expressions.

Currently input is made in forms. The aim is to make it more fluent and "script-like".

The plot window is crude. It needs labels, tick marks and a grid. Probably colour too.
